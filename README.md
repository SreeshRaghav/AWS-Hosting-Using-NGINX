# AWS Hosting Using NGINX

Nginx is used to host websites because it is a high-performance, lightweight, and scalable web server. It efficiently handles concurrent connections, making it ideal for high-traffic sites. Nginx also functions as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and caching server, improving website performance and security. Its event-driven architecture reduces resource consumption compared to traditional servers like Apache. Nginx supports SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring secure communication. Additionally, it is easy to configure, supports static and dynamic content, and integrates well with other web technologies like PHP, Node.js, and Python. These features make Nginx a popular choice for hosting websites.
